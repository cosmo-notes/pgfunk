# Probability generating functions: <br> A computational tool for modeling epidemics

Put some intro for the whole book here.

There exists many references on probability generating functions:
- Miller Primer
- generating functionology
- other combinatorial books?

Here, our goal is to provide a hands-on tutorial on practical *computational* methods based on probability generating functions.
Our main applications will be in epidemiology, on how to describe complex agent-based-models by this set of tools.
