# Probability generating functions for computational epidemiology

Probability generating functions are very extremely useful to characterize complex combinatorial
objects which arise in various fields, such as graph theory or the study of epidemiological
processes.

Here we a list a few references that might be of interest in combination with this tutorial:
- **_A primer on the use of probability generating functions in infectious disease modeling_** {cite}`miller2018primer`
- **_generatingfunctionology_** {cite}`wilf2005generatingfunctionology`. This is a book on the theory of probability generating functions including various applications in discrete mathematics.

Here, our goal is to provide a hands-on tutorial on practical *computational* methods based on probability generating functions.
Our main applications will be in epidemiology, on how to characterize contagion on networks or in complex population by this set of tools.
