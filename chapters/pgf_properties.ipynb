    "For the more computationally minded readers, it might be easier to think of PGFs as mathematical data structure. In a code, you would likely hold the discrete distribution $p_n$ of outcomes $n$ in something like an array or a dictionary with keys $\\lbrace n\\rbrace$ and values $\\lbrace p_n\\rbrace$. Mathematically, we can do the same thing by using the coefficients of a polynomial! The powers of $x$ are simply counting variables corresponding to the indices of our list or the keys of our dictionary, and the coefficients can then be used to store the values. It's clever, but is it useful?\n",
