# Probability generating functions for computational epidemiology

Probability generating functions are extremely useful to characterize complex combinatorial
objects which arise in various fields, such as network science or the study of epidemiological
processes.

Here we a list a few references that might be of interest in combination with this tutorial:
- **_A primer on the use of probability generating functions in infectious disease modeling_** {cite}`miller2018primer`
- **_generatingfunctionology_** {cite}`wilf2005generatingfunctionology`. This is a book on the theory of probability generating functions including various applications in discrete mathematics.

Many theoretical results can be obtained using probability generating functions---critical points of
phase transition, asymptotic behavior of functions, and the moments of distributions of
interest to name a few.
Here, our main goal is to provide a hands-on tutorial on *computational* methods based on probability generating functions. Indeed, numerical approximations are often more flexible when trying to to tackle real world scenarios.
Our main applications will be in epidemiology, on how to characterize contagion on networks or in complex population by this set of tools.
